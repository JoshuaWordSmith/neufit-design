# NEUFIT Design Study

- Northeastern University â€“ Silicon Valley
- CS 6650 scalable Distributed Systems
- 4/22/24 [100 points]

Instead of a Final Exam, please complete this study and design assignment, and submit via Blackboard by 4/24/20. It requires that you refer to Chapters 11, 18, 19 and 20, and apply key concepts from them to the design of a practical distributed system. Credit for this is the same as planned for the final exam. 
Please submit your individual report; this is not a team project.

## Overview

Design for NEUFIT: An NEU Fitness Virtual Gym and Yoga Studio for Remote Fitness

Remote collaboration platforms with video, multimedia and streaming capabilities have become critical in the present situation of shelter at home. Zoom is a platform that many are using, and here is a list of competitive vendor platforms https://www.owler.com/company/zoom

Exercise is very important to one's health, but people cannot go to the gyms etc. due to the lockdown. Design a platform like zoom but which is especially built for facilitating coaching by gym trainers or Yoga instructors etc. with their clients. Example requirements are: coaching should be enabled by video 1:1, as well as a group interaction, multimedia experience. Additionally, trainers need to be able to share the content of 1000 videos on different fitness topics of interest to the individual consumers. Basic features like enrollment, building, payment via a web app are necessary. However, focus your design on the video and streaming + images/audio (i. e., multimedia experience.)

Provide a basic design similar to the practical examples shared in class (Facebook, Instagram etc. tutorials). , Specify the key functional and nonfunctional requirements, details of the user experience in 1:1 and group settings. these also need to be enabled via desktop as well as mobile phone client devices. Provide your solution using architectural diagrams at the application level, and for the infrastructure.

Provide a capacity planning, design detail for this platform. Suppose a few thousand people each use it from different global locations. How do you estimate the number of sessions, number of concurrent sessions (CCU) and translate that to an infrastructure design (i. e., Cloud with VMs or Docker containers).

What are the key considerations in terms of replications and fault tolerance (Ch. 18)? Invoke 4 key distributed systems concepts from Ch. 18 and explain in 1-2 paragraph each how they can be addressed for the NEUFIT platform. Use diagrams as needed.

What are the key considerations in terms of Security of the platform (Ch. 11)? Invoke 4 key distributed systems concepts from Ch. 11 and explain in 1-2 paragraph each how they can be addressed for the NEUFIT platform. Use diagrams as needed.

What are the key considerations in terms of Multimedia (Ch. 19)? Invoke 4 key distributed systems concepts from Ch. 18 and explain in 1-2 paragraph each how they can be addressed for the NEUFIT platform. Use diagrams as needed.

What are the key considerations in terms of Multimedia (Ch. 20)? Invoke 4 key distributed systems concepts from Ch. 20 and explain in 1-2 paragraph each how they can be addressed for the NEUFIT platform. Use diagrams as needed.
